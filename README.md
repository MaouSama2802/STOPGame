# *STOPGame*
## ***This project's idea was possible thanks to somebody very special to me who used to play this game with me, not digitally but in paper, kind of a fun game, the timer and the feelong of knowing words but being under the pressure makes wonder if you know any words at all!!! I really enjoyed working on this.***
## ***Also have to say that this project was part of my java programming MDC class, and I really hope it goes well, I enjoyed this class so much and learnt a lot from it.***
### **This is my first java GUI game where the task is pretty simple: enter in the boxes words that begin with a random letter that are also categorized as any of the 5 possible categories: Name Country, Fruit, Animal, and Color.**
### **As future things I might add to it, I was thinking of a button that would retrieve the info written in the Player's Scores.txt file and show it to the user so they would have that detail implemented on the GUI.**
### **Another idea is the multiplayer mode. My initial approach to this feature was to make it in turns where player 2 would have to play based on the time that player 1 got, and then reduce the points that they got if they had the dame answer in any category.**
